# JavaLab6Optional
The app for the sixth Java laboratory contains code from the lab's slides: https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~acf/java/labs/slides/lab_06.pdf

The load and save method contain code from the following link: https://mkyong.com/swing/java-swing-jfilechooser-example/?fbclid=IwAR34U44rmB7SJS6A47XSablIstSVrwQ6SqfakqnG437MPIycH2u9KW_HXI0

I completed the following optional tasks:

- Adding support for drawing multiple types of components. Creating a new panel, containing a list of available shapes: regular polygon, circle, rain drop and broken glass.  Adapting the configration panel according to the type of the selected shape.

- Using a file chooser in order to specify the file where the image will be saved or load. ( See the attached photo, shapesAndFileChooses.jpg)

- Creating the posibility of deleting a shape by choosing the rubber tool from the configuration panel. (I did not implement the retained mode drawing tho)

** In order to see how the shapes look like, how the file changer works and how the configuration panel has changed, see the attached shapesAndFileChooses.jpg photo
